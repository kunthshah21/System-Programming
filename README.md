# System-Programming
This is a repository which displays my systems programming skills in C programming language. This primarily involves producing code in C, that makes system calls for certain operations such as file manipulation, complex writing, process management, etc. All programs are command line based C codes. 

I will keep updating this repository with other projects and learnings that I come across as I continue to develop them. I have tried to make sure to include a new learning for every single one of this upload with varied difficulty levels. 

Each folder will have a readme file and a make file, that explains that sub project.

Contents: 
1. File Copy: Copy data between files and standard input/output
2. Single File Operations: Performing the following functions on a single file/Directory -> Create file/Directory, Auto detect text vs binary file and append information based on that, Write bytes from file to standard output, Delete file/Directory, rename file/directory.
3. Multi File Operations: This is an extension to the previous project, where I have extended the file operations of rename, create, delete, append text, etc. Over here, the code takes command line arguments with the input of a directory and performs these operations to all files within this directory or any sub directories containing those files.
4. Process Management: This project delves into processes and how they can be performed either in the foreground or in the background. Similar to the previous project it takes in command line arguments and processes those files either in the background or foreground.
5. Pipelines: This C program, showcases interprocess communication using pipes. It allows two processes to exchange data, with one process acting as a data generator and the other as a data consumer.
