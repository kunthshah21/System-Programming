# System-Programming
This is a repository which displays my systems programming skills in C programming language. This primarily involves producing code in C, that makes system calls for certain operations such as file manipulation, complex writing, etc. All programs are command line based C codes. 

I will keep updating this repository with other projects and learnings that I come across as I continue to develop them. This would be in an updating manner, meaning an increased complexity level, with a mini project at the end. 

Each folder will have a readme file and a make file, that explains that sub project.

Contents: 
1. File Copy: Copy data between files and standard input/output
2. Single File Operations: Performing the following functions on a single file/Directory -> Create file/Directory, Auto detect text vs binary file and append information based on that, Write bytes from file to standard output, Delete file/Directory, rename file/directory.
